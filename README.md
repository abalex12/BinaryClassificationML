## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the comparison of different machine learning models on binary classification tasks, enabling users to identify the best-performing model for their data.

## Features

- **Model Specification**: Support for multiple classification algorithms including K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifiers, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes Grid Search for optimal hyperparameter selection.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculates accuracy and F1 score for model performance on training and test datasets.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple functions that can be integrated with any binary classification dataset.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the required libraries using `pip`. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

To use the provided code, follow these steps:

1. Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Specify the target column name.
3. Call the `auto_train_binary_classifier` function with your DataFrame, target column name, and specified models.

Here's an example of how to use the code with the breast cancer dataset:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import pandas as pd

# Load the breast cancer dataset
cancer = load_breast_cancer()
cancer_df = pd.DataFrame(cancer.data, columns=cancer.feature_names)
cancer_df['target'] = pd.Series(cancer.target)

# Specify models and train
models = specify_models()
best_model_name, best_model, train_set_score, test_set_score = auto_train_binary_classifier(
    cancer_df, 'target', models)

# Print results
print(f"Best Model: {best_model_name}")
print(f"Trained Model: {best_model}")
print(f"Training Set Score (F1): {train_set_score}")
print(f"Test Set Score (Accuracy): {test_set_score}")
```

## Dataset

This project currently uses the breast cancer dataset from the `sklearn.datasets` module. This dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The task is to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Results

After running the code, you will receive output indicating:
- The name of the best-performing model.
- The trained model object.
- Training set performance (F1 score).
- Test set performance (Accuracy).
